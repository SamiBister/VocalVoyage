# ADR: Implement Best Practices for Writing Dockerfiles

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

Creating efficient, secure, and maintainable Docker images is crucial for the deployment and operation of containerized applications. Adhering to best practices in writing Dockerfiles ensures optimal performance, reduced image sizes, and enhanced security.

## Decision

We will implement the following best practices in our Dockerfiles:

1. **Use Official and Minimal Base Images**:

   - Select official base images to ensure reliability and security.
   - Opt for minimal images like `alpine` to reduce image size.

2. **Leverage Multi-Stage Builds**:

   - Separate build and runtime environments to include only necessary artifacts in the final image.

3. **Minimize the Number of Layers**:

   - Combine multiple commands into a single `RUN` instruction to reduce layers.

4. **Utilize `.dockerignore` Files**:

   - Exclude unnecessary files and directories from the build context to reduce image size and improve build performance.

5. **Avoid Installing Unnecessary Packages**:

   - Install only essential packages to minimize the attack surface and reduce image size.

6. **Run as a Non-Root User**:

   - Create and switch to a non-root user to enhance security.

7. **Explicitly Set Environment Variables**:

   - Define necessary environment variables using the `ENV` instruction for better configuration management.

8. **Optimize Caching with Build Arguments**:

   - Structure Dockerfile instructions to take advantage of caching, placing frequently changing instructions after stable ones.

9. **Remove Unnecessary Files and Dependencies**:

   - Clean up temporary files and caches within the same `RUN` instruction to prevent them from being added to the image layers.

10. **Document the Dockerfile**:
    - Include comments to explain the purpose of instructions, enhancing readability and maintainability.

## Consequences

- **Positive Outcomes**:

  - Reduced image sizes lead to faster deployment and lower storage costs.
  - Enhanced security by minimizing the attack surface and running as a non-root user.
  - Improved build efficiency and performance through optimized caching and fewer layers.
  - Increased maintainability and readability of Dockerfiles, facilitating easier updates and collaboration.

- **Negative Outcomes**:
  - Initial implementation may require refactoring existing Dockerfiles, demanding time and resources.
  - Developers may need to familiarize themselves with new practices and tools, necessitating training.

By adopting these best practices, we aim to create Docker images that are efficient, secure, and maintainable, thereby improving our overall development and deployment processes.
