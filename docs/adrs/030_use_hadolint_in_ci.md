# ADR: Integrate Hadolint into Continuous Integration Pipeline

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

Ensuring the quality and security of Docker images is paramount in our development process. Dockerfiles, which define these images, must adhere to best practices to prevent issues such as inefficient builds, security vulnerabilities, and maintenance challenges. Manual reviews of Dockerfiles are time-consuming and prone to oversight. Automating this process within our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline can enhance efficiency and consistency.

## Decision

We will integrate **Hadolint**, an open-source Dockerfile linter, into our CI pipeline. Hadolint will automatically analyze our Dockerfiles during the CI process, identifying deviations from best practices and potential issues.

## Consequences

- **Positive Outcomes**:

  - **Automated Quality Assurance**: Incorporating Hadolint into the CI pipeline ensures that Dockerfiles are consistently checked for best practices without manual intervention.
  - **Early Detection of Issues**: Potential problems in Dockerfiles are identified early in the development cycle, reducing the likelihood of defects reaching production.
  - **Enhanced Security**: By enforcing best practices, Hadolint helps mitigate security vulnerabilities associated with improper Dockerfile configurations.
  - **Improved Maintainability**: Consistent adherence to best practices results in Dockerfiles that are easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

- **Negative Outcomes**:
  - **Initial Setup Effort**: Integrating Hadolint into the CI pipeline requires an initial investment of time and resources to configure and test.
  - **Potential Build Interruptions**: Strict enforcement of linting rules may cause build failures, necessitating immediate attention to Dockerfile corrections.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Install Hadolint**:

   - Add Hadolint to the CI environment using a pre-built binary or Docker image.

2. **Configure Hadolint**:

   - Create a `.hadolint.yaml` configuration file in the repository's root to customize linting rules as per project requirements.

3. **Integrate into CI Pipeline**:

   - Add a step in the CI workflow to execute Hadolint against the project's Dockerfiles.
   - Configure the CI pipeline to fail builds if Hadolint detects issues that exceed a defined severity threshold.

4. **Monitor and Maintain**:
   - Regularly review and update the Hadolint configuration to align with evolving best practices and project needs.
   - Educate the development team on interpreting Hadolint reports and resolving identified issues.

By integrating Hadolint into our CI pipeline, we aim to automate the enforcement of Dockerfile best practices, thereby enhancing the quality, security, and maintainability of our Docker images.
