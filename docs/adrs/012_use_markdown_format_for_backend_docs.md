# Architectural Decision Record: Use Sphinx with Markdown Support for Generating Backend Documentation

## Status

Approved

## Date

2024-11-30

## Context

Our backend project requires a robust documentation tool to create comprehensive and easily maintainable documentation. Since we primarily use Markdown for documentation due to its GitHub-native support and flexibility in transforming to various formats (e.g., HTML, PDF), the tool must support Markdown files. Additionally, it should provide extensibility and integration into our CI/CD pipelines.

## Decision

We have decided to use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) as the documentation generation tool for our backend, leveraging the `sphinx-markdown-builder` and `myst-parser` extensions to enable Markdown support.

### Rationale

1. **Markdown Compatibility**:
   - `sphinx-markdown-builder` allows exporting Sphinx documentation into Markdown.
   - `myst-parser` enables Sphinx to parse Markdown files directly.
2. **Transformational Flexibility**: Using Sphinx enables generating documentation in multiple formats (e.g., HTML, PDF, Markdown) from a single source.
3. **Extensibility**: Sphinx has a rich ecosystem of extensions to support additional features such as API documentation, search integration, and custom styling.
4. **Community and Support**: Sphinx is widely adopted and well-documented, with an active community for troubleshooting and improvements.
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Sphinx can easily integrate into our pipelines to automate documentation generation during builds.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Centralized Documentation**: Sphinx provides a single source of truth for all documentation formats, ensuring consistency.
- **Automation**: Documentation can be auto-generated and updated as part of the development workflow.
- **Rich Features**: Advanced features like cross-referencing, indexing, and search are available out-of-the-box.
- **Markdown Flexibility**: Retains our preference for Markdown as the primary documentation format.

### Negative Consequences

- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Configuring Sphinx with the required extensions and Markdown support involves additional effort.
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to learn Sphinx's configuration and extensions.
- **Dependency Management**: Adds dependencies (`sphinx`, `sphinx-markdown-builder`, `myst-parser`) that require maintenance.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **MkDocs**

   - Pros: Native Markdown support, simple configuration, lightweight.
   - Cons: Limited extensibility and fewer features compared to Sphinx.

2. **Jekyll**

   - Pros: GitHub Pages integration, Markdown-native.
   - Cons: Requires Ruby environment; less robust for complex documentation needs.

3. **Manual Documentation Management**
   - Pros: No additional dependencies.
   - Cons: High maintenance overhead; lacks automation and advanced features.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install sphinx sphinx-markdown-builder myst-parser
   ```

2. **Initialize Sphinx Project**:
   Run the following to set up a basic Sphinx configuration:

   ```bash
   sphinx-quickstart
   ```

3. **Update `conf.py`**:
   Configure Sphinx to use Markdown with `myst-parser`:

   ```python
   extensions = [
       'myst_parser',
       'sphinx_markdown_builder'
   ]
   source_suffix = {
       '.rst': 'restructuredtext',
       '.md': 'markdown',
   }
   ```

4. **Organize Markdown Files**:
   Place Markdown documentation files in the appropriate directories.

5. **Build Documentation**:
   Generate documentation in the desired format using:

   ```bash
   sphinx-build -b html docs/ build/html
   sphinx-build -b markdown docs/ build/markdown
   ```

6. **Integrate with CI/CD**:
   Automate documentation generation and deployment:

   ```yaml
   steps:
     - name: Generate Documentation
       run: sphinx-build -b html docs/ build/html
     - name: Deploy Documentation
       run: # Deployment commands (e.g., upload to server, GitHub Pages)
   ```

7. **Update Developer Guide**:
   Document the usage and contribution guidelines for Sphinx and Markdown in the README.
