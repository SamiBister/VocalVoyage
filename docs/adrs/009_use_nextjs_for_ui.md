# Use Next.js for Frontend Development

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed a frontend framework that supports modern web application requirements, including server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and seamless integration with APIs. The chosen framework had to offer high performance, scalability, and ease of development to align with our application goals.

After evaluating various frontend frameworks, we decided to adopt **Next.js**, a React-based framework, for the following reasons:

- **Performance:** Out-of-the-box support for server-side rendering and static site generation ensures fast load times and SEO-friendly pages.
- **Developer Experience:** Provides built-in features such as routing, code-splitting, and API routes, reducing boilerplate and simplifying development.
- **Flexibility:** Supports both client-side and server-side rendering, allowing us to choose the best approach for different parts of the application.
- **Community and Ecosystem:** Backed by Vercel and a large community, ensuring ongoing support and access to plugins and tools.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle small projects as well as enterprise-level applications.

## Decision

We have decided to use **Next.js** as the primary frontend framework for our application. This decision is based on the following factors:

1. **Built-in SSR and SSG:** Native support for server-side rendering and static site generation ensures high performance and SEO optimization.
2. **API Integration:** Built-in API routes make it easy to integrate backend services without additional tools.
3. **React Ecosystem:** Next.js is built on React, enabling us to leverage existing React libraries and developer expertise.
4. **Deployment Simplicity:** Works seamlessly with Vercel and other deployment platforms for rapid and efficient deployment workflows.
5. **Modern Features:** Includes support for TypeScript, image optimization, and dynamic imports, enhancing development productivity.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Improved Performance:** Server-side rendering and static generation reduce page load times and improve SEO.
- **Developer Efficiency:** Reduces boilerplate and simplifies the development workflow with built-in routing and API handling.
- **Future-Proofing:** Active development and growing adoption ensure long-term viability.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for both small-scale and enterprise-level applications.

### Negative

- **Learning Curve:** Developers unfamiliar with Next.js may require time to learn its features and best practices.
- **Server Overhead:** Server-side rendering introduces some operational overhead compared to purely client-side frameworks.
- **Dependency Management:** Relies on the React ecosystem, which can occasionally lead to issues with dependency updates.

## Follow-Up Actions

1. **Team Training:** Provide training on Next.js, including key features like SSR, SSG, and API routes.
2. **Initial Setup:** Set up the Next.js project structure and integrate it with the backend.
3. **Documentation:** Document the project's architecture and guidelines for using Next.js effectively.
4. **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor performance metrics to ensure optimal usage of SSR and SSG.
5. **Integration with CI/CD:** Incorporate Next.js into the CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.

## Alternatives Considered

- **React with Create React App (CRA):** While CRA is simpler, it lacks built-in SSR and SSG, requiring additional libraries and configurations for equivalent functionality.
- **Gatsby:** Offers strong static site generation capabilities but is less flexible for dynamic applications and API integrations compared to Next.js.
- **Angular:** A full-featured framework but more complex and less aligned with our team's expertise in React.

## Summary

Next.js offers the best combination of performance, flexibility, and developer productivity for our frontend needs. Its modern features, seamless integration with APIs, and support for server-side rendering and static generation make it the optimal choice for building a scalable and high-performance frontend application.
