# Use Docstrings for Code Documentation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Effective documentation is critical for maintaining a high-quality codebase, ensuring that team members and collaborators can understand and use the code effectively. Docstrings are the standard way of providing inline documentation in Python, and their adoption aligns with our goals of clarity, maintainability, and knowledge sharing.

Key considerations for this decision included:

- **Readability:** The documentation should be easily accessible and close to the source code.
- **Consistency:** Following a standard approach for documentation improves readability and reduces cognitive overhead.
- **Tooling Support:** Docstrings integrate seamlessly with Python tools and IDEs, enabling features like autocompletion and inline help.
- **Future-proofing:** Docstrings can be used to generate external documentation automatically using tools like Sphinx or pdoc.

## Decision

We have decided to enforce the use of **docstrings** for all functions, classes, and modules across the codebase. This decision is based on the following:

1. **Standardized Documentation:** Docstrings follow PEP 257, the Python Enhancement Proposal for documenting Python code, ensuring consistency across the project.
2. **Ease of Use:** Docstrings are inline and immediately available to developers working in the code.
3. **Integration with Tools:** Many tools (e.g., IDEs, linters, Sphinx) support docstrings natively, allowing for enhanced developer productivity and automatic documentation generation.
4. **Improved Collaboration:** Clear and consistent documentation lowers the learning curve for new contributors and reduces dependency on specific individuals for knowledge sharing.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Enhanced Readability:** Developers can quickly understand the purpose and usage of functions, classes, and modules.
- **Improved Productivity:** IDEs and tools leverage docstrings for features like autocompletion and inline help.
- **Automated Documentation:** Docstrings can be used to generate external documentation, reducing duplication of effort.
- **Knowledge Retention:** Reduces reliance on tribal knowledge by embedding context and intent directly in the code.

### Negative

- **Initial Overhead:** Writing comprehensive docstrings for existing code may require additional effort.
- **Enforcement:** Requires adherence to the standard through code reviews and tooling.
- **Risk of Outdated Documentation:** Docstrings must be maintained to stay relevant with code changes, requiring diligence from developers.

## Follow-Up Actions

1. **Establish Standards:** Define guidelines for writing docstrings, including format (e.g., Google, NumPy, or reStructuredText style).
2. **Tooling Integration:** Add linters (e.g., Pylint, Flake8-docstrings) to enforce docstring standards in the CI/CD pipeline.
3. **Team Training:** Conduct training sessions or share resources to familiarize the team with writing high-quality docstrings.
4. **Incremental Adoption:** Gradually add docstrings to existing code during refactoring or feature updates.
5. **Documentation Generation:** Explore tools like Sphinx or pdoc to automatically generate external documentation from docstrings.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Inline Comments:** While inline comments provide context, they are not as structured or standardized as docstrings and cannot be easily used for external documentation.
- **External Documentation:** Storing documentation outside the code (e.g., in a `docs/` folder) can work but lacks the immediacy and ease of access provided by inline docstrings.
- **No Documentation Enforcement:** Skipping documentation enforcement risks poor knowledge sharing and increases onboarding time for new developers.

## Summary

Using docstrings for code documentation ensures consistency, improves readability, and integrates seamlessly with Python tools and workflows. While there is an initial overhead, the long-term benefits of maintainability, collaboration, and productivity outweigh the costs. This decision aligns with our commitment to maintaining a high-quality and developer-friendly codebase.
