# Use FastAPI as the Backend Framework

## Status

Accepted

## Context

After deciding to use Python as the backend programming language, we needed to select a framework that aligns with our requirements for developing a high-performance, scalable, and modern web API. The framework choice had to consider the following factors:

- **Performance:** The application demands a lightweight, efficient, and fast framework.
- **Ease of Use:** Developer productivity and ease of creating RESTful APIs are essential.
- **Modern Features:** Support for asynchronous programming, automatic OpenAPI documentation, and type hinting.
- **Community and Ecosystem:** A growing and active community for long-term support.

Several Python frameworks were evaluated, including Flask, Django, and FastAPI.

## Decision

We have chosen **FastAPI** as the backend framework for the following reasons:

1. **Asynchronous Programming:** FastAPI is built on ASGI and supports asynchronous programming out of the box, enabling high performance for I/O-bound tasks.
2. **Modern Design:** Leverages Python type hints to provide robust validation, better developer experience, and clear code documentation.
3. **Automatic Documentation:** Generates OpenAPI and JSON Schema documentation automatically, reducing development overhead.
4. **Performance:** FastAPI is one of the fastest Python web frameworks, suitable for high-performance APIs.
5. **Community Adoption:** FastAPI is increasingly popular with strong support from the Python community and a growing ecosystem of tools.
6. **Ease of Learning:** The framework's simplicity and alignment with Python standards ensure a low learning curve for the team.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Improved Developer Productivity:** Automatic validation, documentation, and type hints reduce boilerplate and improve code quality.
- **Scalability:** Asynchronous capabilities allow efficient handling of concurrent requests.
- **Standards Compliance:** Built-in OpenAPI and JSON Schema adherence make it easier to integrate with client applications.
- **Enhanced Performance:** Delivers performance comparable to Node.js frameworks like Express.

### Negative

- **Learning Curve:** Team members unfamiliar with asynchronous programming may require initial training.
- **Ecosystem Maturity:** While FastAPI has a growing ecosystem, it is newer than Flask or Django, potentially requiring custom integrations for certain advanced features.
- **Deployment Considerations:** As FastAPI relies on ASGI, deployment requires compatible servers like Uvicorn or Daphne, adding a layer of complexity.
