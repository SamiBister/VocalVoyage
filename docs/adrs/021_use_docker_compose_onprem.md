# ADR: Adoption of Docker Compose for On-Premises Deployment

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

Deploying applications across diverse on-premises systems presents challenges in ensuring consistent environments, efficient resource utilization, and streamlined deployment processes. Traditional deployment methods often lead to discrepancies between development and production environments, complicating maintenance and scaling efforts.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt **Docker Compose** as the primary tool for orchestrating multi-container applications in our on-premises deployments. Docker Compose will define and manage the services, networks, and volumes required for our applications, facilitating consistent and reproducible deployments across all environments.

## Consequences

- **Positive Outcomes**:
  - **Simplified Deployment**: Docker Compose allows for defining multi-container applications in a single YAML file, streamlining the deployment process.
  - **Consistency Across Environments**: Utilizing Docker Compose ensures that applications run uniformly across development, testing, and production environments, reducing environment-specific issues.
  - **Scalability**: Services can be scaled easily by adjusting configurations in the `docker-compose.yml` file, allowing for flexible resource management.
  - **Enhanced Collaboration**: Configuration files can be version-controlled and shared among team members, promoting collaboration and transparency.

- **Negative Outcomes**:
  - **Limited Orchestration Features**: Docker Compose is designed for single-host deployments and may not provide the advanced orchestration capabilities required for complex, multi-host environments.
  - **Manual Scaling and Recovery**: Lacks automated scaling and self-healing features, necessitating manual intervention for scaling services and recovering from failures.
  - **Resource Management**: Inefficient resource allocation can lead to performance bottlenecks, requiring careful planning and monitoring.

By adopting Docker Compose, we aim to achieve a more streamlined and consistent deployment process for our on-premises applications, while being mindful of its limitations in complex orchestration scenarios.
