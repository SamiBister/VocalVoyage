# Use Python as Backend Language

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed to select a backend programming language for our application. The decision required consideration of the following factors:

- **Team Expertise:** The team has significant experience with Python, which would reduce onboarding time and accelerate development.
- **Ecosystem:** Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django, FastAPI) that suit our needs for both rapid development and scalability.
- **Community Support:** Python has an extensive and active community, ensuring access to resources, libraries, and solutions for common problems.
- **Use Cases:** Our application requires data processing and integration with AI/ML components, areas where Python excels.
- **Performance:** While not as performant as some compiled languages, Python provides adequate performance for our anticipated workload and scales well when paired with appropriate infrastructure.

## Decision

We have decided to use **Python** as the backend programming language for our application. The reasons for this decision include:

1. **Ease of Development:** Python's simplicity and readability enable rapid prototyping and development, reducing time-to-market.
2. **Framework Versatility:** Frameworks like Django and FastAPI offer options for both full-stack development and lightweight, high-performance APIs.
3. **Integration with AI/ML Tools:** Python's dominance in the AI/ML space allows seamless integration with tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Pandas.
4. **Team Efficiency:** Leveraging the team's expertise minimizes the learning curve and avoids delays.
5. **Community Support:** Access to a large community ensures better troubleshooting and long-term maintainability.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Faster Development:** The team's familiarity with Python accelerates development timelines.
- **Rich Ecosystem:** Availability of libraries for tasks ranging from web development to data analysis reduces custom development effort.
- **Scalability Options:** Scalability can be achieved through optimization techniques and using infrastructure like AWS Lambda, Kubernetes, or other horizontal scaling solutions.

### Negative

- **Performance Limitations:** Python's performance may lag behind some other languages (e.g., Go, Java) in high-performance scenarios.
- **Concurrency:** Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can pose challenges for CPU-bound tasks, although these can be mitigated using asynchronous programming or external tools.
- **Deployment:** While Python is widely used, some deployment environments may require additional configuration compared to statically typed compiled languages.

## Follow-Up Actions

1. Evaluate and choose a Python web framework (e.g., Flask, Django, FastAPI) based on project requirements.
2. Define best practices for Python coding and establish guidelines for maintainability and performance.
3. Identify potential performance bottlenecks early and explore options for optimization or parallelization.
4. Plan infrastructure to address scaling and deployment needs.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Node.js:** Offers high performance for I/O-bound tasks but lacks the team's expertise.
- **Go:** High performance and concurrency features, but would introduce a significant learning curve.
- **Java:** Mature ecosystem and performance, but the team preferred Python for its simplicity and agility.
