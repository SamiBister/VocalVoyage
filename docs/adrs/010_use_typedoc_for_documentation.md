# Architectural Decision Record: Use TypeDoc for Documentation in TypeScript Project

## Status

Approved

## Date

2024-11-30

## Context

We need a documentation tool for our TypeScript project that can automatically generate well-structured, human-readable documentation from the codebase. The selected tool must support TypeScript natively, be easy to integrate into the build process, and provide output that aligns with modern web standards for developer documentation.

## Decision

We have decided to use [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) as the documentation tool for our TypeScript project.

### Rationale

1. **TypeScript Native Support**: TypeDoc is specifically designed for TypeScript projects and handles TypeScript types, interfaces, and other constructs seamlessly.
2. **Ease of Integration**: TypeDoc integrates smoothly with TypeScript and other build tools like npm and webpack, making it easy to include in our CI/CD pipelines.
3. **Customizable Output**: It provides multiple themes and configurations, allowing us to customize the output to fit our project's needs.
4. **Active Maintenance**: TypeDoc is actively maintained and supported, ensuring compatibility with the latest TypeScript features.
5. **Community Adoption**: A large user base and community ensure a wealth of tutorials, plugins, and extensions.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Developers can easily navigate and understand the codebase through auto-generated, up-to-date documentation.
- **Time Savings**: Automated documentation reduces the manual effort needed to maintain and update project documentation.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that documentation adheres to a consistent format and structure across the project.

### Negative Consequences

- **Initial Learning Curve**: Team members may need time to learn TypeDoc's configuration and usage.
- **Build Overhead**: Generating documentation as part of the build process may slightly increase build times.
- **Dependency Management**: Adds an additional dependency to the project, requiring periodic updates and compatibility checks.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **JSDoc**

   - Pros: Wide adoption, supports JavaScript and TypeScript.
   - Cons: TypeScript support is less native compared to TypeDoc; configuration can be more complex.

2. **Manual Documentation**

   - Pros: Complete control over content and format.
   - Cons: High maintenance overhead, prone to inconsistencies and becoming outdated.

3. **Third-Party Documentation Platforms (e.g., GitBook, Docusaurus)**
   - Pros: Rich features and advanced customization.
   - Cons: Requires significant manual input and doesn't auto-generate from code.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Install TypeDoc**:

   ```bash
   npm install typedoc --save-dev
   ```

2. **Configure TypeDoc**:
   Create a `typedoc.json` configuration file with the following contents:

   ```json
   {
     "entryPoints": ["src/index.ts"],
     "out": "docs",
     "theme": "default",
     "tsconfig": "tsconfig.json"
   }
   ```

3. **Integrate into Build Process**:
   Add a script in `package.json`:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "docs": "typedoc"
   }
   ```

4. **Automate Documentation Generation**:
   Configure CI/CD pipelines to generate documentation as part of the build process.
