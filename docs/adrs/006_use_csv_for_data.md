# Use CSV Files as Data Source with File Upload Functionality

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For our application, we needed a convenient and straightforward way to manage and process data. CSV files provide a lightweight and widely-used format for data storage and exchange. To enhance user convenience, we also decided to allow users to upload CSV files directly.

The following considerations were taken into account:

- **Simplicity:** CSV files are easy to create, edit, and use with standard tools like spreadsheets.
- **Use Case:** The system is intended for use by a single person on a local machine, minimizing complexity and operational overhead.
- **Security Risk:** While file uploads inherently carry some security risks, the intended local usage scenario significantly mitigates these risks.

## Decision

We have decided to use **CSV files** as the primary data source and enable file uploads for convenience. The reasons for this decision are:

1. **Ease of Use:** CSV files are easy to handle, allowing users to manage data without specialized knowledge or tools.
2. **Compatibility:** CSV files are supported by nearly all data tools and programming libraries, ensuring seamless integration.
3. **Lightweight Format:** CSV is a simple text-based format with minimal overhead, making it efficient for local use cases.
4. **Convenience of Uploads:** Allowing file uploads simplifies data entry and enables users to quickly import data without manual input.
5. **Risk Mitigation Through Intended Use:** The application is expected to be used by a single person on a local machine, reducing exposure to potential file upload security risks.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **User-Friendly:** Users can easily manage and upload their data using familiar tools.
- **Simplicity:** The lightweight nature of CSV files reduces complexity in data handling and storage.
- **Performance:** Processing small CSV files locally ensures fast and efficient operation.

### Negative

- **Limited Scalability:** CSV files are not ideal for large-scale or multi-user environments.
- **Potential for Errors:** Manual handling of CSV files may introduce formatting errors or inconsistencies.
- **Security Risks (Mitigated):** While file uploads could introduce risks, the intended single-user, local scenario significantly reduces this concern. However, misuse outside the intended use case could pose a risk.

## Follow-Up Actions

1. **Validation on Upload:** Implement validation to ensure uploaded CSV files adhere to the expected format and structure.
2. **Error Handling:** Provide clear error messages for formatting issues or invalid data.
3. **Documentation:** Clearly document the intended usage scenario and limitations to avoid misuse.
4. **Optional Enhancements:** Explore adding checks for file size or type to further mitigate potential misuse.
5. **Monitor Feedback:** Gather user feedback to determine if the current approach meets their needs or requires adjustments.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Database Storage:** Provides scalability and multi-user support but introduces additional complexity not required for the intended single-user use case.
- **JSON Files:** More structured than CSV but less user-friendly for non-technical users and not as widely supported by common tools.
- **Online Uploads:** Allowing uploads in a multi-user environment would require significant security measures, which are unnecessary for the current scope.

## Summary

Using CSV files as the data source with file upload functionality provides a simple, user-friendly, and efficient solution for the intended single-user, local use case. While there are inherent risks with file uploads, the local usage scenario mitigates these risks effectively. This approach aligns with the projectâ€™s goals of simplicity and convenience while keeping security considerations in check.
