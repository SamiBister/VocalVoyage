# ADR: **Use GitVersion to Implement Semantic Versioning**

- **Date:** 2024-12-21
- **Status:** Accepted

## Context

We need a **consistent and automated** approach to apply [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) in our repository. Manual version updates often lead to errors or inconsistencies in tagged releases, creating confusion around which commits introduce breaking changes, new features, or fixes. We want to ensure:

1. **Accuracy** in version numbers to reflect the scope of changes.
2. **Automation** so the team doesn’t need to manually manage version increments.
3. **Clarity** for developers, release managers, and downstream consumers regarding each release’s potential impact.

## Decision

**Use [GitVersion](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion)** to implement **Semantic Versioning** automatically for our repository. Specifically, we will:

1. **Configure GitVersion** with a `GitVersion.yml` file to define our branching and versioning strategy (e.g., `ContinuousDelivery` or `ContinuousDeployment`).
2. **Integrate GitVersion** into our CI pipeline (GitHub Actions), so each commit, pull request, or merge can produce a **SemVer**-compliant version.
3. **Tag releases** with the version string generated by GitVersion, ensuring any consumer knows exactly what type of changes to expect.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual Versioning**
   - Developers manually increment `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
   - Prone to human error, inconsistent application, and confusion when multiple contributors are involved.
2. **Other Automated Tools**
   - Tools like `semantic-release` or custom scripts could also handle version increments.
   - However, GitVersion directly integrates with Git, supports various branching strategies, and is widely adopted.

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

- **Consistency**: Every release number is derived from a standard formula tied to Git commit history.
- **Reduced Overhead**: Developers no longer manually bump versions—GitVersion does it automatically.
- **Clear Communication**: The version string immediately indicates the **type** of changes (breaking, feature, or fix), reinforcing Semantic Versioning principles.

### Potential Downsides

- **Learning Curve**: The team must become familiar with GitVersion’s configuration and branching rules.
- **Configuration Overhead**: We must maintain a `GitVersion.yml` to reflect our branching strategy and commit message patterns accurately.
